\documentclass{pbml}

% This is a sample file for the PBML article.
% You can compile it with (ordered by preference)
%  1. XeLaTeX with installed fonts TeX Gyre Pagella and DejaVu
%  2. XeLaTeX without the fonts -> you must use \documentclass[nofonts]{pbml}
%  3. pdfLaTeX
%
% In all three methods, you can use Unicode (utf8) encoding for special letters
% (so instead of na\"{i}ve you can write directly naïve).
% Note that with methods 2 and 3, your output will be slightly DIFFERENT than
% our final print version (different line breaks and page breaks).
% See the end of this file for more information.

% Packages
% ========
% In this place you can load required packages by the \usepackage commands.
% The following packages are loaded automatically by the class:
% euler    (for math fonts)
% graphicx (for inclusion of images)
% multicol (for multicolumn typesetting)
% natbib   (for bibliography citations)
% amssymb  (for various symbols)
% If XeLaTeX is used, fontspec and xltxtra are loaded as well.

% Definitions
% ===========
% You can use your own macros defined by \newcommand, \providecommand,
% \DeclareRobustCommand (or even by \def) as well as environments declared by
% \newenvironment. You can also use \newcounter in order to declare your own counters.

% custom packages
\usepackage{xcolor}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{cleveref}
\usepackage{booktabs}
\input{MACROS.tex}
% decrease table/figure margin bottom
\setlength{\belowcaptionskip}{-5pt}

% Document title and authors
% ==========================
% Due to journal organization, the article title and authors must be specified
% AFTER \begin{document}. Note that \subtitle is not allowed anymore due to
% problems with indexing in science databases. If needed use colon in the title.

\title{Leveraging Neural Machine Translation for Word Alignment}


% Now put the affiliated institutes first, then author names and the labels
% of their institutes in the "institute" field. The order of institutes and
% authors printed below the title will be the same as the order of your commands.
% Each author can be associated with more than one institute.
% One author must be chosen as the "corresponding author" (using attribute
% corresponding) and his or her email and full address must be provided.
% PLEASE, use Unicode (utf8) encoding (e.g ï instead of \"{i}).
% PLEASE, include country name in the address and
% follow the names listed in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1

\begin{abstract}
The most common tools for word-alignment rely on a large amount of parallel sentences, which are then usually processed according to one of the IBM model algorithms. The training data is, however, the same as for machine translation (MT) systems, especially for neural MT (NMT), which itself is able to produce word-alignments using the trained attention heads. This is convenient because word-alignment is theoretically a viable byproduct of any attention-based NMT, which is also able to provide decoder scores for a translated sentence pair.

We summarize different approaches on how word-alignment can be extracted from alignment scores and then explore ways in which scores can be extracted from NMT, focusing on inferring the word-alignment scores based on output sentence and token probabilities. We compare this to the extraction of alignment scores from attention.
We conclude with aggregating all of the sources of alignment scores into a simple feed-forward network which achieves the best results when combined alignment extractors are used.

% Bibliography
% ============
% You may either enter the bibliography manually, possibly making use of
% \label and \ref, or use BibTeX. The bibliography style is set
% automatically. You process the bibliography by BibTeX in the
% standard way and include it by:
\bibliography{mybib}

% ======= Additional information ==========

% XeLaTeX
% =======
% The Prague Bulletin of Mathematical Linguistics is typeset by XeLaTeX.
% It is not required that you use XeLaTeX and the same fonts as will be used in the
% journal but it is better to do so if you could (so you have the same line and page breaks).
% If XeLaTeX is not available on your computer, you can even used standard LaTeX.

% Fonts
% =====
% In the printed version, fonts TeX Gyre Pagella (shipped with TeX Live 2008 or later)
% and DejaVu (http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)
% will be used. If you have XeLaTeX but not these fonts, you may need to install
% the fonts somewhere where your system (fontconfig) can find them. On Linux,
% try something like this:
% ln -s YOUR-TEXLIVE/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/ \
%  ${HOME}/.fonts/texlive-2008-otf-public
% If you are not able to install these fonts, you can instruct XeLaTeX
% to use its default fonts by \document[nofonts]{pbml}.

% If you want to typset examples in east Asian scripts, you have to use
% OpenType Unicode fonts that are freely redistributable and you have to
% include them with your article. If you must use nonfree or non-Unicode
% fonts, you must supply the examples as EPS or PDF with fonts embedded in
% the files (as the required subset).
% If encountering problems with the "bidi" package, contact pbml@ufal.mff.cuni.cz.

% Vector Graphics
% ===============
% The most portable graphics package is tikz which is a front end to pgf.
% This package is fully supported both in standard LaTeX and XeLaTeX.
% PSTricks is not currently available for XeLaTeX.

% Color Images
% ============
% The printed version of PBML does not allow color figures, so please convert
% all your figures to grayscale (or black&white), make sure they are legible
% and put them in a subdirectory called "grayscale".
% When specifying the filename in \includegraphics DO NOT include the
% subdirectory.
% Optionally, in addition to the default grayscale images, you can add also
% color versions of the figures to be published in the online version.
% Put such images in a subdirectory called "color" with the same filenames
% as the grayscale ones.
% To temporarily switch to color output and hypertext links, use
% \documentclass[color]{pbml}

% Including images and other files
% ===================================
% When loading the file you must use a relative path, never the full path.
% Load the images by \includegraphics
% and other files by \input, never use \include.
